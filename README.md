# Team Profile Generator

This is a team profile generator CLI application. It is a streamlined way to put all of your teammembers' information on cards and display them on an HTML page. All of the team members may be added all at once or additional team members can be added on later on. 

# Usage

after cloning, the user must install the following packages: 

fs
util
inquirer
path

Simply type in `npm install ' followed by the individual package listed above, one by one. 

Once the packages are installed, run `node app.js` and then follow the prompts. 

All of the data will be exported automatically to index.html which may be opened on any browser.
